# File description

On the corpus files, we are still trying to figure it out whether we could upload the files without breaching the copyright limitation. Now we could only upload 10 samples for each translation group.

And scripts are now under development for a software pack, thus we can only share some key part of the scripts. 

<!-- The feature set table in the printed paper is scaled due to length limitation, so you may refer to /Fig/Feature_set.png for the whole feature set. -->

If you have any questions, please contact the author.


# Todo:
- [ ] Upload data files and feature files.
- [ ] Upload experiment results.
- [ ] Upload corpus samples.
- [ ] Upload scripts.
(Sorry about the delay, too much things in hand at the moment, I will try to finish sorting everything out before Dec. 2025)
